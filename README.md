# akpsi-slack-bot

A simple slack bot application I made for my fraternity's operations and officer workspace! It dives into two main features of replies and slash commands.

The reply feature answers commonly asked questions (like event dates) and the slash command feature is boilerplate for anything you could imagine. Right now it's just a placeholder that receives a slash command and outputs a confirmation.

As a whole, this is basically a skeleton code to a Slack app - I may or may not update and further define it in the future as my goal was simply to practice with API calls, Slack's API, deployment and more.
